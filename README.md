# Raycasting-tutorial-series
A series of progressive implementations based on the Permadi raycasting tutorial

The Permadi tutorial can be found at https://permadi.com/1996/05/ray-casting-tutorial-4/

The series is progressive - each next implementation builds upon the previous one. So in order to understand the code, I advise to start at the first implementation (that is part 9a - these numbers refer to the Permadi tutorial parts), and work your way through the series. It helps of course if you check out the Permadi tutorial while looking through the code.

In each cpp file I added a short description where I summarize what that particular part is about. 

There are a few dependencies:
1. all implementations are built upon the olcPixelGameEngine.h header file by JavidX9 (see: 
2. for most of the implementations you need some sprite files (.png) for the texturing. Adapt the code to load these sprite files in OnUserCreate() to get it working on your setup.

Have fun with it!
